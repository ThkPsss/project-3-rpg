# Project 3: Steampunk RPG (With React)

## Description

This game was inspired by Oldschool RPGs and D&D 5th Edition. Using the D&D 5th Edition API we were able to take aspects of the worlds most popular table top RPG. This app's back-end makeup is mostly JavaScript and the front-end is made up of React. The Setting is in a Steampunk World where monsters run wild. The Story will be more flushed out later on into devlopment.

## Classes


There were many classes to choose from in the D&D but for the early version of this game we choose to hard-code three of the classes in. In future development I would like to make a flexable function that will create buttons for every class that the API returns back.

### Fighter


The Fighter class was added into this version of the game as a basic close-combat class that specialize in the Strenght stat. Fighters have the highest hp because of their hit die. Everytime the Fighter levels up, they will gain the most hitpoints from it.

### Wizard


The Wizard class was added as a simple magic user that  specialized in Intelligence stat. Later into development this class will shine when spells work to their full potental. This class' damage will scale the highest from the default three classes. 

### Ranger


The Ranger class is the final class that was added to act as long range fighter that would specialize in Dexterity stat. Later into development this class will be used a nimble fighter that will dodge attacks and capitalize on critical strikes. This class is for people that like to play as glass cannons.

## Races


Races add a new level of depth and customization for the player. Classes in D&D not only give the player freedom with gameplay but new mechanic and bonuses. Classes come with stat bonuses and minor abilities that the play will be able to use in future development. 

### Human


The human race is the most basic and most flexable race in D&D and that applies here too. Humans gain a single stat point in every stat making it viable in any class with no handicaps. The human don't have any abilities that come with the class making it a very straight forward class to use.

### Elf


Elfs are a basis to any fantasy game. Elfs are a race of noble people and as such gain two points in Dexterity when the user chooses this class for their character. While this class can be used in any class, the Ranger class would fit the Elf the best in this verison of the game due to the Ranger utilizing Dexterity the best.

### Dwarf


Dwarfs are the short, roudy people in fantasy story that any player would love to play. The Dwarf gains two points into Constitution to prove they are harder to put down then their counter-parts. Because of the free bonus in health that the Dwarf recives, he would be best sutied as a Fighter, the tankiest class in this version of the game.


## Future Development

There is a lot of additions that we would love to add to this App. Here is a list of the planned devlopment:

> * Saving

> * Accounts

> * Items

> * Inventory

> * Abilties and Spells

> * Exp and leveling up

## Issuse 

Development was rough because of the handicap of making this in a week. But the main issue we ran into was mostly React related. JSX for the most part confused us and React's structure didn't help. React was personal not user friendly and slowed down all parts of development for this group. The bigger problems were:

> * Buttons in general were a pain (Ex. On click with the characterCreation page)

> * Creating functions and utilizing them didn't really make too much sense to me since it was so different from what have been doing from the start of JavaScript. I felt there was no easy way to test if functions even worked.

> * State was also a confusing topic. We basicly understand what it is used for but don't know how to use it to its full capabilties. 

> * The database is connected and is in the app but is not used.

## Conclusion

For the most part this app is useless untill we figure out how to use React on a higher level, but a lot was learned from trial and error. This is because even though there are still a lot of problems, we also fixed a lot of problems found earlier in the app.
